  Data fetching with Gatsby and GraphQL (Starter template)
</h1>

## ðŸš€ Quick start

This is starter files for the [Gatsby data fetching project](https://gatsbydatafetchinggraphql.gatsbyjs.io/). To download or clone this starter project, run the following command from your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/gatsby-starter-data-fetching
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, switch inside the project directory (`cd gatsby-starter-data-fetching`) and run:

```
npm install
```

This will create a local `node_modules` folder and install all the necessary dependencies inside it.

Finally, open the project with your code editor and start the development server by running:

```
gatsby develop
```

You should see the gatsby site in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
